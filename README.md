INTRODUCTION: 
In developing countries, the economy is highly based on agriculture but we lack in proper utilization of resources available to us.
This is mainly because of the unplanned use of water for irrigation.  Although there are many modern irrigation techniques like drip irrigation 
and sprinkler irrigation farmers have to visit the farms in person regularly in order to water their crops. i.e., it is manually controlled.  
All these problems results in wastage of human and  agricultural  resources as  well  as  time.  Hence, there is a need for making an automatic
irrigation system. Literature reports different techniques implemented for automatic irrigation systems

OBJECTIVES: 
To provides proper and needed amount of water for different region and avert the water overflow 
at the sloppy areas and considering the situation of farmer, the water irrigation system will be most 
useful for proper irrigation. The proper water supply system is the major examine in cropping system.
